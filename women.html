										<h1>Womens History and Rights in Japan Research</h1>
									</header>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/women1.png" alt="" /></span><b><font size="+1">Around the time 
										that LGBTQ+ relationships were being questioned, the feminist movement for women in Japan began with 
										the western influence looming Japan during the Meji Restoration era. This influence brought a lot of 
										strives for the feminist moving, some strives being the restriction in trafficking women, girls being 
										required to obtain education, and the right to request divorces. The first association for women’s rights 
										in Japan, The Red Wave Society, was formed in April 1921. This movement aimed to attack the harsh affects 
										that capitalism had on women since during this time, many women were either working 12-hour long shifts in 
										poor conditions or had turned women into slaves or prostitutes (2. Tsurumi, E. Patricia).</font></b></p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="" alt="" /></span><b><font size="+1">Around the same 
										time in the 1920, the women’s suffrage movement was in full affect for Japanese women. By 1921, women
										 were allowed to attend political meetings, but they were still not allowed to vote. After the end of 
										 World War II, in February of 1946, Japanese women were finally granted the right to vote, which is one
										  of the biggest strides made during this time.
							</font></b></p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/womens3.png" alt="" /></span><b><font size="+1"> Towards the end of the 
										1960s, a new feminist movement came to be, WLM (women’s liberation movement), which was rooted in the
										 idea of Japanese women progressing from being considered second-class citizens(1. Bullock, Allan). This same movement 
										 was happening at the same time as other countries, such as the United States, had women fighting for
										  civil rights. One of the main issues WLM aimed to tackle in Japan were reproduction and autonomy rights.
									</font></b></p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="" alt="" /></span><b><font size="+1"> As of 2021, gender 
										equality still seems far away for Japanese women, this is because of the traditional gender roles 
										that are still being upheld. These gender roles are boiled down to men being the ‘breadwinner’ while 
										the women are stay-at-home mothers. Due to these gender roles, the birth rate and the marriage rate 
										has dropped significantly, a growing problem for not only women but men too as they have reported
										 feeling inadequate in being able to sustain a family(3. Oi, M.).
